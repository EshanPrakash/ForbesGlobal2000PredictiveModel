### Data Collection

The first step was determining an efficient way to collect Forbes Global 2000 data from previous years. Instead of manually going through the datasets uploaded by Forbes onto their website, I instead chose to collect data through user-uploaded databases on Kaggle. I downloaded these datasets off of Kaggle in the csv file format, which made each of these datasets compatible with the Pandas Python library. Use of the Pandas library allowed for specific information on corporations, which made the processes of data organization and anlaysis easier later down the line. Through preliminary data analysis, I discovered that a number of corporations consistently placed in the top 10 of the Global 2000 over a period of multiple years. This was useful information since the end goal of this project was to predict what corporations would be most likely to place in the top 10 of the Global 2000 in 2024. As a result, I could utilize 2023 Global 2000 data to make predictions for 2024. This meant that, for the purposes of training a model, I could only use data up until 2021.
